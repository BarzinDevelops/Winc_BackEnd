CLI -> Command Line Interface
Command line -> somewhere on a computer (phone or tablet) where you can type commands.
terminal (is an application) -> application that allows you to type in commands. 
console -> sometimes used instead of terminal  (like your browse console)
shell -> software running inside of a terminal that allows you to interact with the OS. You can run
	   different shells on a terminal. (like powershell, fish, zshell, bash shell etc..) 

prompt -> the characters before the cursur on each new command line. 
	    (the default prompt will be different per shell and can be configured).
REPL (= Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop->  (the command line for a programming language). when you enter the programming
	  language in your shell then you enter the REPL for that language. (it has its specific command line that
        can understand the commands in that language).
